# Rubbish Raiders
An RTS game about sorting and properly segregating waste at a construction site for Android.

Drag the screen to move the camera, and pinch to zoom in or out.  
Tap the timers above the workers to see what they're holding, and make a decision about where it should go by pressing one of the buttons.  
Tap the 'Clear Waste' button above the skips to send a truck to come pick up the waste from the skip.

Try to clear as much as possible, while saving money, and get a good rank!
